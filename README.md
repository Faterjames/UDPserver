# UDPserver
a quite lightweight UDPserver

include a simple JSON compiler , you can use it to anlyse your JSON message:)

# Something
JSON compiler :)
heartbeat to make sure this port is listened :)
use threadPool to work background :)
change your code in Runnable object and use it in execute method :)

# USER

Just include this project and new a UDPserver

  UDPserver server = new UDPserver;
 
 then UDPserver.startUDPserver(prot:);
 and then you already listen this port;
 
I think everyone should change my code to make what you want :)
